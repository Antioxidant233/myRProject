# AbunRNA
An R package developed to wrap up the commonly used RNA-seq analysis pipelines from the initial quality check, sanity check, to quantification on transcript expression, then to the downstream analysis.

## Installation

A paragraph that describes the purpose of your R package. Explain how your package add to or improve a current work flow in bioinformatics or computational biology (i.e., how is it unique?, what issue does it address?). Finally, include the R version (not RStudio version) and platform (Mac, Windows, Linux (Debian, Fedora/Redhat, Ubuntu)), used to develop the package. There should be no `Shiny` implementation at this point. You may obtain this information by running ``` utils::sessionInfo()```. E.g., 
<br>
<br>
<br>

`AbunRNA` is an R package to demonstrate components of a simple R package. This includes the main components: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man subdirectory and R subdirectory. Additionally, LICENSE, README and subdirectories vignettes, tests, data and inst are also explored. The package is targeted for BCB410H (Applied Bioinformatics) students, who are to define a useful tool for the analysis of biological data in the format of a public R package housed on GitHub. The scope of the R package is to add to or improve a current work flow in bioinformatics or computational biology. The tool should contain functions to perform analysis of biological data and to produce a compelling graphical output, ideally to support for exploratory analysis. The `TestingPackage` package was developed using `R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10)`, `Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)` and `Running under: macOS Big Sur 11.2`.


## Installation
To install the latest version of the package:
``` r
require("devtools")
install_github("zhangchengyue/AbunRNA", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("AbunRNA")
```

To run the Shiny app:
``` r
runAbunRNA()
```

## Overview

Provide the following commands, customized to your R package. Then provide an overview to briefly describe the main components of the package. Include one image illustrating the overview of the package, that shows the inputs and outputs. Ensure the image is deposited in the correct location, as discussed in class. Point the user to vignettes for a tutorial of your package. E.g., 
<br>
<br>
<br>
``` r
ls("package:TestingPackage")
data(package = "TestingPackage") 
browseVignettes("TestingPackage")
```
`TestingPackage` contains 4 functions to demonstrate components of a simple R package. The *InfCriteriaCalculation* function calculates the information criteria values. Specifically, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Integrated Complete Likelihood (ICL) are calculated. The *InfCriteriaPlot* generates a plot of information criteria values. *NormFactors* is a function that calculates normalization factors via Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM). The *runTestingPackage* is the function that launches the shiny app for this package. The package also contains two RNA sequencing datasets, called GeneCounts and GeneCounts2. Refer to package vignettes for more details. An overview of the package is illustrated below.
